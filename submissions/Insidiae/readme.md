# Create a Spotify Data Logger feat. D3.js

## How To Run

This is a simple HTML+CSS+JS app. To make sure the fetch requests for the dataset can run properly, you might want to run this app via a simple localhost server (or just use the Live Server extension if you're using VSCode):

```sh
# Make sure you've navigated into submissions/Insidiae via the terminal:
npx serve
```
